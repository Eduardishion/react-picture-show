### How slides work

Slides are the direct child components of a ``<PictureShow/>``. They are cloned with the following additional properties:

```jsx
  {
    width: Number, // the width of the mounted slideshow
    height: Number, // the height of the mounted slideshow
    pending: Boolean // whether the slide can be lazyloaded
  }
```
By cloning the children with these props, you are free to create 'slide' components that react to them however you want. If the child already has one of these props it will be replaced (even for ```<img/>``` components)
